What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think what happens is that it will track what are the files and directories in
a given directory where git is initialized initially. So it would be like tracking
from initially nothing to what are the files and directories in a given directory
where git is initialised.

Why do I need to do it manually and not automatically done by Git is that I might
have some files or directories that I dont want Git to track. So in order to do
that, the only option is that I have to do it manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area differs from working directory and repository in the sense that it
is an intermediate between them. Working directory doesn't go straight to repository
rather than it is added first to the staging area. I think the benefit it offers
is giving the user flexibility to choose on what to commit. It is beneficial because
users might not want to commit every file in their repositories since it might be
private to be shared with others.
